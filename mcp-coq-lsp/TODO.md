# mcp-coq-lsp TODO

## High priority

- [ ] **`coq_search` tool** — Search for lemmas/theorems without polluting the source file. Runs `Search <pattern>.` speculatively via a temp state and returns results as messages. Equivalent to `Search` in Proof General.

- [ ] **`coq_check_term` / `coq_about` tools** — Check the type of a term, print its definition, or get info. Same speculative approach as search.

- [ ] **`coq_undo` tool** — Remove the last N tactics from the file and re-sync. Currently the LLM must compute inverse text edits manually.

- [ ] **`coq_try_tactic` combined tool** — Single call: `try_tactic(file, position, tactic) → {new_state_id, goals}`, collapsing the current 3-call speculative flow (`get_state_at_pos` → `run_tactic` → `goals_for_state`) into one.

- [ ] **Fix `follow_with_goals` in `coq_insert_tactic`** — Currently queries goals at the *insertion point*. Should query goals at the position *after* the newly inserted text, so the caller sees the effect of the tactic.

## Medium priority

- [ ] **Human-readable goal formatting** — Add a `format` option that returns goals as structured plaintext (hypotheses + goal separator), matching Proof General / coqtop output. The raw JSON `ty`/`hyps` fields are machine-parseable but hard to read.

- [ ] **`coq_script` tool** — Return the full proof script (content of the .v file) so the LLM can see what's been built so far without reading the file via a separate tool.

- [ ] **`coq_fill_hole` workflow tool** — High-level: "take this Admitted proof, replace it with these tactics, and verify". Combines open, edit, replace, check into one call.

## Low priority

- [x] **Dynamic workspace switching** — When a file is opened, the server walks up from its directory looking for `_CoqProject`/`_RocqProject`/`dune-project` and restarts coq-lsp with the correct workspace root automatically.

- [ ] **`coq_reset` tool** — Reset the document to a known state (useful after speculative exploration).

- [ ] **Multi-file project support** — Track open documents across multiple .v files in the same project, sharing a coq-lsp instance.

- [ ] **Error message formatting** — Return diagnostics in a more readable form (currently raw JSON).

## Done

- [x] `coq_open_goals` — query goals at a position
- [x] `coq_proof_state` — richer proof context
- [x] `coq_get_state_at_pos` — Pétanque state identifier
- [x] `coq_run_tactic` — speculative tactic execution
- [x] `coq_goals_for_state` — goals from a state ID
- [x] `coq_apply_edit` — apply text edits and re-sync
- [x] `coq_insert_tactic` — insert tactic helper
- [x] `coq_check` — force document checking
- [x] `coq_check_range` — check a specific line range
- [x] `coq_search` — speculative `Search` via Pétanque
- [x] `coq_check_term` / `coq_about` — speculative `Check` / `About`
- [x] `coq_undo` — remove last N spans and re-sync
- [x] `coq_try_tactic` — single-call speculative tactic execution
- [x] Fix `follow_with_goals` — query goals after inserted text, not at insertion point
- [x] Dynamic workspace switching — auto-detect project root from file path
